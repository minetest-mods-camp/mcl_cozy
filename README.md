[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rudzik8/mcl_cozy/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rudzik8/mcl_cozy/)

Adds commands to /lay or /sit to the MineClone 2/5/a game. Port of good old [cozy mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=14143) (originally made for MTG by everamzah) to work with MCL properly and even provide some nice new features!
